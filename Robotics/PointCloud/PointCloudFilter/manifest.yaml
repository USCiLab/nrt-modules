    synopsis: Filters a point cloud. 
    description: > 
      Processes a point cloud by filtering it in varying manners such as outlier
      removal, region removal, or voxelization.
      
      Many filters use a specific field in a point cloud to perform
      filtering, such as the geometry, point normals, or color information.
      Though only this field will determine which points are filtered, all
      attributes related to a point will be affected.
